# Ecom Marketplace

A repository for a project I developed during semester 6.

## Contents

### Backend
The repository contains 3 microservices - Product, Shopping Cart and Image. 
The microservices are developed using Express Typescript. 

### Frontend
The frontend is written in React Typescript. 

### Databases
The services use cloud hosted MongoDB and Redis databases.

## Note
This repository is for the purpose of showcasing code only.
To be ran properly, the services require a .env file containing the database connection strings.
This file is removed from the repository for security purposes.
